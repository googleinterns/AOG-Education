    "A SLIM RASCAL",
    "Old Mr. Crow often remarked that if Grumpy Weasel really wanted to be of some use in the world he would spend his time at the sawmill filling knot holes in boards.",
    "'He's so slender,' Mr. Crow would say, 'that he can push himself into a knot hole no bigger round than Farmer Green's thumb.'",
    "Naturally it did not please old Mr. Crow when Solomon Owl went out of his way one day to tell him that he was sadly mistaken. For after hearing some gossip repeat Mr. Crow's opinion Solomon Owl--the wise old bird--had given several long hoots and hurried off, though it was broad daylight, to set Mr. Crow right."
